Hi Everyone !

I believe by now we all had heard of BITCOIN - (BTC)...=)

-News from the future of fresh digital curency! 

The way of control is back in your hands and no one else.
Making the future more fun to be born into!!!Where everything has value. 
Meaning that money will have no denomination over work one does. You will be awarded by tokens of your own shop or familly members created token currency backed up by the digital assets safely disributed over the overal caclulator of today. Yes . That is the internet and computers allowing to step into the creative way of preparing better future for all today and evreyone tommorow and tomorrows to come. 

Lets make everything valued so no sweat is not leave not noticed. As we value our lifes. We value our kids and our surroundings.

Your actions and time spend is not a waste of time. We allowing other peoples to have jobs and to be our celebrities and etc:, 

We not all enjoying the monetary systems which putting us and future generations at risk. Betting from our own future kids.. is cruel=( 

We do works which one does not enjoy not because we cannot have job we would enjoy but the works which one pays more. 

Why then not we make that who wants more not to take that of others ...but to compete in digitally created games and become recognised in the world as anyone could in any fiels of profession and skills. Work always respect us.... Become the example of the skills and power one need to become that what one later can practice from instead just learning what might never can be working. 

To have more is an idea in the mind. And yes it makes us growth if we want more , but it does not leave a positive marks for many future generations of the other continents of the world. 

Why not to start something fresh . If something doesnt work ...maybe it never ment to be fixed. Because it never acted in the benefit of ALL. New money doesnt have transaction cost which increases every year of todays market of the past 200 hundred and more years ...

Starvation ...still  a problem in the modern world...illnesses like an invisible war..Failed marrages ...failed relationship ...Everyone betting of each other lifes..as if the work sometimes one does cannot do more damage when good. Not because we cannot do ...Just because we dont want to ...we dont want to change even when we ourselfs doesnt enjoy. Why we would lie to others then. Let be honest once ...Do we really just care of ourselfs ? or we really care for better. ? and if evoliution one supposed finnished . Why everything still moving? =)
